      <title>Getting started with Rust on RISCV (ch32)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Blog post I will explore the process of setting up a minimal rust project for embedded baremetal development. The focus is on getting up and running including setting up a debugging flow for instruction stepping fully integrated into my editor of choice (emacs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of 2025 many popular microcontrollers such as the esp32 already have a big rust community and some easy templates to get up and running with rust. But even less popular devices already have basic infrastructure in place, though setting up a project to do development on them is a bit more of an exploratory experience. Still a lot of the heavy lifting has already been solved. I still remember when first started doing some embedded rust development in 2019, there was little to build upon, so getting started involved bootstrapping a peripheral access crate and start writing a hardware abstraction layer. That is to say that within the last six years the ecosystem for embedded rust projects has evolved impressively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming the Raspberry Pi with Rust ðŸ¦€</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post serves as a summary for a live code I did at our local hacker space. For the full experience please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/iCbES_JHKyM&#34;&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Though I probably should warn that the live coding was done in German (and next time I should make sure to increase the font size everywhere for the recording ðŸ™ˆ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From zero to a working rust project for the raspberry pi. These are the required steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Hardware Peripherals</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been doing programming for embedded systems such as the&#xA;esp32 and esp8266, and additionally I did a course on embedded systems for&#xA;my masters degree. This introduced me to the wonderful world of programming&#xA;close to the hardware level, and inspired me to write this post about&#xA;hardware peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-are-hardware-peripherals&#34;&gt;What are Hardware Peripherals?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hardware Peripherals are specialized pieces of silicon that are built into&#xA;a processor. They are used to perform a diverse set of task. This includes&#xA;controlling the processors clock speed, power management and communication&#xA;with other devices. They are responsible for configuring the device operation&#xA;and during operation are used to perform tasks in parallel with the main&#xA;cores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
