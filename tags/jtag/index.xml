      <description>I did a seminar talk on JTAG and how to use it to check a PCB for errors. For this i designed a little board in order to simulate manufacturing errors. In this post I want to give you a short introduction to JTAG and how to use it.
What is Boundary-scan Boundary-scan was developed to simplify testing of integrated circuits. To do this the Joint Test Action Group introduced the Boundary Scan architecture as a standard and today it has replaced the old testing methods because of its cost efficiency and speed up of test development and execution.</description>
